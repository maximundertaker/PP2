# Python - Join Sets
# Join Sets
# There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.
# - The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.
# - The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.
# - The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).
# - The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.

# Union
# The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets.

# Example
# Join set1 and set2 into a new set:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

print(" ")
# You can use the | operator instead of the union() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use | to join two sets:
set1 = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1 | set2
print(set3)

print(" ")
# Join Multiple Sets
# All the joining methods and operators can be used to join multiple sets.
# When using a method, just add more sets in the parentheses, separated by commas:

# Example
# Join multiple sets with the union() method:
set1 = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = {'John', 'Elena'}
set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

myset = set1.union(set2, set3, set4)
print(myset)

print(" ")
# When using the | operator, separate the sets with more | operators:

# Example
# Use | to join two sets:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

myset = set1 | set2 | set3 |set4
print(myset)

print(" ")
# Join a Set and a Tuple
# The union() method allows you to join a set with other data types, like lists or tuples.
# The result will be a set.

# Example
# Join a set with a tuple:
x = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
y = {1, 2, 3}
z = x.union(y)
print(z)

print(" ")
# Note: The  | operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the  union() method.

# Update
# The update() method inserts all items from one set into another.
# The update() changes the original set, and does not return a new set.

# Example
# The update() method inserts the items in set2 into set1:
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set1.update(set2)
print(set1)

# Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.
print(" ")
# Intersection
# Keep ONLY the duplicates
# The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.

# Example
# Join set1 and set2, but keep only the duplicates:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set3)

print(" ")
# You can use the & operator instead of the intersection() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use & to join two sets:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set3 = set1 & set2
print(set3)

print(" ")
# Note: The & operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the intersection() method.
# The intersection_update() method will also keep ONLY the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

# Example
# Keep the items that exist in both set1, and set2:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set1.intersection_update(set2)
print(set1)

print(" ")
# The values True and 1 are considered the same value. The same goes for False and 0.

# Example
# Join sets that contains the values True, False, 1, and 0, and see what is considered as duplicates:
set1 = {"apple", 1, "banana", 0, "cherry"}
set2 = {False, "google", 1, "apple", 2, True}
set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set3)

print(" ")
# Difference
# The difference() method will return a new set that will contain only the items from the first set that are not present in the other set.

# Example
# Keep all items from set1 that are not in set2:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set3)

print(" ")
# You can use the - operator instead of the difference() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use - to join two sets:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set3 = set1 - set2
print(set3)

print(" ")
# Note: The - operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the difference() method.
# The difference_update() method will also keep the items from the first set that are not in the other set, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

# Example
# Use the difference_update() method to keep the items that are not present in both sets:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set1.difference_update(set2)
print(set1)

print(" ")
# Symmetric Differences
# The symmetric_difference() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.

# Example
# Keep the items that are not present in both sets:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print(set3)

print(" ")
# You can use the ^ operator instead of the symmetric_difference() method, and you will get the same result.

# Example
# Use ^ to join two sets:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set3 = set1 ^ set2
print(set3)

print(" ")
# Note: The ^ operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the symmetric_difference() method.
# The symmetric_difference_update() method will also keep all but the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.

# Example
# Use the symmetric_difference_update() method to keep the items that are not present in both sets:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)
print(set1)
